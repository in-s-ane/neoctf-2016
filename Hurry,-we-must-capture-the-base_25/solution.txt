We are given three strings that probably represents the flag. Given the name of the problem,
it was clear that these three strings were encoded in different bases.

ZmxhZ3s= -> "flag{" (base64)
MJAHGZK7HU====== -> "b@se_=" (base32)
63 61 70 74 75 72 65 64 7d -> "captured}" (hex aka base 16)

Combine the strings to make the flag

flag{b@se_=captured}
