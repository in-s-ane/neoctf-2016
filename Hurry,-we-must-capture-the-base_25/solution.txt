We are given three strings that probably represents the flag. Given the name of the problem,
it was clear that these three strings were encoded in different bases.
Indeed, the first string was encoded in base64 and yields "flag{"
The second string was encoded in base32 and yields "b@se_="
The final string was just a bunch of hex, and yields "captured}"

Combine the strings to make the flag

flag{b@se_=captured}
