Looking up Apache Tomcat vulnerabilities, we find an exploit involving .war files by uploading them
to the server. However, to do this, we need to log in to the admin interface. Using metasploit's
built-in tomcat manager cracker (tomcat_mgr_deploy), we find that the credentials are admin:password.

I also found a .war file online which would allow us to execute commands on the server.
Upload cmd.war to the server and go to /cmd/cmd.jsp to execute commands.

Immediately, we see /flag.txt, but only the root user can see its contents.
The commands cat, tail, head, and more don't work, but a little bit of investigation
reveals that a binary in /usr/bin/moar actually runs as root and that it just runs cat.
With this information, we can read the flag.

$ ./shell.sh
$ moar --help
Usage: cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...
...
$ moar /flag.txt

flag{really_gud_password_but_wait_theres_moar}
