Looking up tomcat vulnerabilities, we find an exploit involving .war files by uploading them
to the server. However, to do this, we need to log in to the admin interface. Using metasploit's
built-in tomcat manager cracker, we find that the credentials are admin:password.

I also found a .war file online which would allow us to execute commands on the server. See cmd.war

Immediately, we see /flag.txt, but it's only visible by root.
cat, tail, head, and more don't work, but the command moar does.

$ ./shell.sh
$ moar /flag.txt

flag{really_gud_password_but_wait_theres_moar}
