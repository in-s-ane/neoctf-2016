We cannot view the file as a doc, because it is actually a zipped archive.

Unzipping the archive gives us contents similar to an Apple pages document, but that doesn't matter.
Viewing preview.jpg gives us the contents of the document, and we notice a strange string.

    jr;[ ,r@@@ nrgptr o hp. jrtr od yjr f;sh" g;sh)f4s4+yu[2mh|

It turns out that this string was encrypted via keyboard shifting. If we shift all the keys to the
left by one, we get decode the message and get the flag.
