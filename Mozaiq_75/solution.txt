Searching up the problem name, Mozaiq, we find an online steganography tool where we hide messages within images.
The hint in the problem tells us that there is no password, so we can just input the picture into the web form at
http://mozaiq.org/decrypt.

Decrypting the message without a password gives us the flag.
flag{0BSCUR3_InN0}
