Note that the problem was broken due to image compression on image uploading sites.

We can reverse search the png for an image of the same size, which leads us to the only result:
https://hoydic.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/sports.jpg

The original image is a jpg, but we are given a png. Using an online tool like http://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-png,
we can convert the jpg into a png and compare the difference between the photos.

    $ compare original-converted.png Sports.png -compose src diff.png

Open up diff.png to see the flag:
flag{S0cc3r_1s_d@_b0mb}
